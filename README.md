# Breast_Cancer_Classification
 This Python script is a full pipeline for breast cancer classification using machine learning.It includes:

- Fetching the dataset from the UCI repository (fetch_ucirepo).
- Performing exploratory data analysis (EDA) with statistical summaries and visualizations.
- Preprocessing data, including standardization and feature selection.
- Splitting data into training and testing sets.
- Training multiple machine learning models, including:
  Logistic Regression (L1 & L2)
  Random Forest
  Gradient Boosted Trees
  Bagged Trees
- Hyperparameter tuning with GridSearchCV.
- Evaluating model performance using accuracy, recall, precision, ROC-AUC, and confusion matrices.
- Comparing models and analyzing feature importance.

🔍 Key Features:

✔ Automated dataset fetching – No manual CSV upload needed.

✔ Data cleaning and preprocessing – Handles missing values, renames columns, and standardizes features.

✔ Comprehensive EDA – Includes scatterplots, distributions, and aggregated statistics.

✔ Hyperparameter tuning – Optimizes model parameters for best performance.

✔ Multiple classification models – Compares various ML approaches for cancer prediction.

✔ Detailed evaluation – Uses multiple metrics, including ROC curves and feature importance analysis.

✔ Visual insights – Plots confusion matrices, bar charts, and performance comparisons.

🚀 Use Case:

This script is ideal for data scientists and ML practitioners looking to analyze and classify benign vs. malignant breast cancer efficiently. The modular structure allows easy modifications for other medical datasets.
